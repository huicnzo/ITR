Production - 
piece , batch , mass

piece - no auto { each componetn we are designing one by one }
batch - flexible auto { limited no. of designs }
mass - hard auto / fixed auto {only one unique design mimmicing that with 1000s of same product }

robotics is an example of flexible automation .

Could you pls reexplain batch production and mass production and their relation to flexible automation?

in mass production u already gave ur design my objective is to create replica of that , hard coding thing is involved .... in flexible auto we can reprogram it .


how we will define automation?

process of reducing human muscle power

in 1940s transistors came into market .. therfore mechanical systems changed into electro - mechanical .

microprocessor - concept of reprogram ..... 

What is robot?
 
 
A electro-mechanic device that shud some or all of following activities -

1. able to move around
2. it should be reprogrammable with the controller we will be having 
3. the device should be able to sense and manipulate the environment
4. multifunctional
5. display intelligent behaviours


intelligent behaviors- 
 learning from past experiences the way human do .
 & making decisions 
 if it actively responds to the new unknown expsures .



# intelligent?
system which can deal with unknown , unforeseen & corrupted data .

suppose am making a bot whhich will detect obstacles , using some kind of ultrasonic sensors ...when it is detecting all the sensors will not give the ideal value .. some sensors will give you that noisy data some sensors will be faulty ..

manipulator 
legged robot 
wheel robot
underwater
aerial


manipulator - machine that has functions like human upper limbs & moves objects spatially

all these definitons is a little biased with industrial point of view 



# robotics

which deals with issue ralted to design  manufacturing & usage of robtots.

multidisciplinary subjects -mechanical , electrical , computer , control , ai

3H of human are copied in robot 
hand - manipulator
heart - emotion
head -

# Nc machines

numerically controlled machines , the tools can move x & y dirn .
(limited moves)

in robots we can cover much larger region & one more benefit is that we can reprogram it .
